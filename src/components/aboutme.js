          First off what I think is important to know about me is I like to learn and build stuff.
          I spend most of my spare time building something or programming. I have over 4 years of 
          experiences as a Software/Research Engineer working in a fast growing company.
          I have experience building CAD/CAM software for the manufacturing industry, HVAC controls,
          image processing, and inventory tracking systems. My ideal job is one in which I can interact
          with my users, learn new things, and gain experience with architecure and poject management.
